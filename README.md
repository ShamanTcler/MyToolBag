# MyToolBag
As an engineer/software developer I have sets of tools I like to use. 

This work is completely independent of my employer.

Please see the wiki for more details.

The branching scheme I will follow is known as "Git Flow", here is an article discussing the approach:https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ Granted as the author points out I may not need the rigor this apporach offers for this particular work, but it is what I use in "real life". At my age I have no desire to ebe flexible.
